## ipy2pdf

Script to convert _notebook.ipynb_, containing russian/cyrrilic symbols, into _notebook.pdf_.

| Installation | Usage | Output |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| `python install.py` | `ipy2pdf notebook.ipynb` | `notebook.pdf` |

That's easy.

## Requirements

You need to have `pdflatex` already installed on your system. And of course `jupyter` ðŸŒš.

On my system I have [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) installed.
